These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.</p></blockquote><p>Location: 70</p><blockquote><p>while Mark Twain wrote much of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer in a shed on the property of the Quarry Farm in New York, where he was spending the summer.

Instead of a novel that will be around for a long time‚Ä¶ there is a bunch of e-mail messages that I have sent out to individual persons.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>Location: 99</p><blockquote><p>Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.</p></blockquote><p>Location: 116</p><blockquote><p>changing society, for sure, but in ways that‚Äôll make us better off.

As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.</p></blockquote><p>Location: 292</p><blockquote><p>the economist Sherwin Rosen worked out the mathematics behind these ‚Äúwinner-take-all‚Äù markets.

It‚Äôs also true, however, that some periods offer more advantages than others. As Brynjolfsson and McAfee point out, postwar Europe was an example of a bad time to be sitting on a pile of cash, as the combination of rapid inflation and aggressive taxation wiped out old fortunes with surprising speed (what we might call the ‚ÄúDownton Abbey Effect‚Äù).</p></blockquote><p>Location: 312</p><blockquote><p>rewards are returned, roughly speaking, proportional to the input.

It does not make them immoral. It does not even make them unpopular. It makes them invisible and therefore irrelevant.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>Location: 821</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúThe satisfactions of manifesting oneself concretely in the world through manual competence have been known to make a man quiet and easy,‚Äù explains Matthew Crawford.</p></blockquote><p>Location: 823</p><blockquote><p>Craftsmen like Furrer tackle professional challenges that are simple to define but difficult to execute‚Äîa useful imbalance when seeking purpose. Knowledge work exchanges this clarity for ambiguity. It can be hard to define exactly what a given knowledge worker does and how it differs from another: On our worst days, it can seem that all knowledge work boils down to the same exhausting roil of e-mails and PowerPoint, with only the charts used in the slides differentiating one career from another.</p></blockquote><p>Location: 849</p><blockquote><p>Like fingers pointing to the moon, other diverse disciplines from anthropology to education, behavioral economics to family counseling, similarly suggest that the skillful management of attention is the sine qua non of the good life and the key to improving virtually every aspect of your experience.</p></blockquote><p>Location: 852</p><blockquote><p>We tend to place a lot of emphasis on our circumstances, assuming that what happens to us (or fails to happen) determines how we feel. From this perspective, the small-scale details of how you spend your day aren‚Äôt that important, because what matters are the large-scale outcomes, such as whether or not you get a promotion or move to that nicer apartment. According to Gallagher, decades of research contradict this understanding. Our brains instead construct our worldview based on what we pay attention to. If you focus on a cancer diagnosis, you and your life become unhappy and dark, but if you focus instead on an evening martini, you and your life become more pleasant‚Äîeven though the circumstances in both scenarios are the same. As Gallagher summarizes: ‚ÄúWho you are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love‚Äîis the sum of what you focus on.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>Location: 862</p><blockquote><p>She provides the example of a couple fighting over inequitable splitting of household chores. ‚ÄúRather than continuing to focus on your partner‚Äôs selfishness and sloth,‚Äù she suggests, ‚Äúyou might focus on the fact that at least a festering conflict has been aired, which is the first step toward a solution to the problem, and to your improved mood.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>Location: 876</p><blockquote><p>Gallagher‚Äôs theory, therefore, predicts that if you spend enough time in this state, your mind will understand your world as rich in meaning and importance. There is, however, a hidden but equally important benefit to cultivating rapt attention in your workday: Such concentration hijacks your attention apparatus, preventing you from noticing the many smaller and less</p></blockquote><p>Location: 879</p><blockquote><p>pleasant things that unavoidably and persistently populate our lives.</p></blockquote><p>Location: 884</p><blockquote><p>Following are the subject lines of these messages along with summaries of their contents: ‚Ä¢ Re: URGENT calnewport Brand Registration Confirmation. This message was in response to a standard scam in which a company tries to trick website owners into registering their domain in China. I was annoyed that they kept spamming me, so I lost my cool and responded (futilely, of course) by telling them their scam would be more convincing if they spelled ‚Äúwebsite‚Äù correctly in their e-mails. ‚Ä¢ Re: S R.

This message was part of a conversation in which a colleague and I were reacting to some thorny office politics issues (of the type that are frequent and clich√©d in academic departments).</p></blockquote><p>Location: 894</p><blockquote><p>These e-mails provide a nice case study of the type of shallow concerns that vie for your attention in a knowledge work setting. Some of the issues presented in these sample messages are benign, such as discussing an interesting article, some are vaguely stressful, such as the conversation on retirement savings strategies (a type of conversation which almost always concludes with you not doing the right things), some are frustrating, such as trying to arrange a meeting around busy schedules, and some are explicitly negative, such as angry responses to scammers or worried discussions about office politics.</p></blockquote><p>Location: 899</p><blockquote><p>Many knowledge workers spend most of their working day interacting with these types of shallow concerns. Even when they‚Äôre required to complete something more involved, the habit of frequently checking inboxes ensures that these issues remain at the forefront of their attention.</p></blockquote><p>Location: 905</p><blockquote><p>‚Äòthe idle mind is the devil‚Äôs workshop‚Äô‚Ä¶ when you lose focus, your mind tends to fix on what could be wrong with your life instead of what‚Äôs right.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>Location: 933</p><blockquote><p>Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed.</p></blockquote><p>Location: 948</p><blockquote><p>‚Äújobs should be redesigned so that they resemble as closely as possible flow activities.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>Location: 958</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúThe world used to be, in its various forms, a world of sacred, shining things,‚Äù Dreyfus and Kelly explain early in the book. ‚ÄúThe shining things now seem far away.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>Location: 964</p><blockquote><p>tasked ourselves to identify what‚Äôs meaningful and what‚Äôs not, an exercise that can seem arbitrary and induce a creeping nihilism. ‚ÄúThe Enlightenment‚Äôs metaphysical embrace of the autonomous individual leads not just to a boring life,‚Äù Dreyfus and Kelly worry; ‚Äúit leads almost inevitably to a nearly unlivable one.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>Location: 973</p><blockquote><p>‚Äúsubtle virtues‚Äù of his medium, they note, the craftsman has stumbled onto something crucial in a post-Enlightenment world: a source of meaning sited outside the individual. The wheelwright doesn‚Äôt decide arbitrarily which virtues of the wood he works are valuable and which are not; this value is inherent in the wood and the task it‚Äôs meant to perform.</p></blockquote><p>Location: 976</p><blockquote><p>The task of a craftsman, they conclude, ‚Äúis not to generate meaning, but rather to cultivate in himself the skill of discerning the meanings that are already there.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>Location: 978</p><blockquote><p>this meaning seems safer than the sources cited in previous eras.

The machine, which takes its name from the ancient Greek concept of eudaimonia (a state in which you‚Äôre achieving your full human potential), turns out to be a building. ‚ÄúThe goal of the machine,‚Äù David explained, ‚Äúis to create a setting where the users can get into a state of deep human flourishing‚Äîcreating work that‚Äôs at the absolute extent of their personal abilities.‚Äù It is, in other words, a space designed for the sole purpose of enabling the deepest possible deep work. I was, as you might expect, intrigued. As Dewane explained the machine to me, he grabbed a pen to sketch its proposed layout. The structure is a one-story narrow rectangle made up of five rooms, placed in a line, one after another. There‚Äôs no shared hallway: you have to pass through one room to get to the next. As Dewane explains, ‚Äú[The lack of circulation] is critical because it doesn‚Äôt allow you to bypass any of the spaces as you get deeper into the machine.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>Location: 1,078</p><blockquote><p>Tierney): ‚ÄúDesire turned out to be the norm, not the exception.‚Äù The five most common desires these subjects fought include, not surprisingly, eating, sleeping, and sex.

Your ritual needs to ensure your brain gets the support it needs to keep operating at a high level of depth. For example, the ritual might specify that you start with a cup of good coffee, or make sure you have access to enough food of the right type to maintain energy, or integrate light exercise such as walking to help keep the mind clear.</p></blockquote><p>Location: 1,453</p><blockquote><p>Expose yourself to ideas in hubs on a regular basis, but maintain a spoke in which to work deeply on what you encounter.</p></blockquote><p>Location: 1,467</p><blockquote><p>whiteboard effect.

Lag measures describe the thing you‚Äôre ultimately trying to improve. For example, if your goal is to increase customer satisfaction in your bakery, then the relevant lag measure is your customer satisfaction scores. As the 4DX authors explain, the problem with lag measures is that they come too late to change your behavior: ‚ÄúWhen you receive them, the performance that drove them is already in the past.‚Äù Lead measures, on the other hand, ‚Äúmeasure the new behaviors that will drive success on the lag measures.‚Äù In the bakery example, a good lead measure might be the number of customers who receive free samples. This is a number you can directly increase by giving out more samples. As you increase this number, your lag measures will likely eventually improve as well.</p></blockquote><p>Location: 1,524</p><blockquote><p>relevant lead measure: time spent in a state of deep work dedicated toward your wildly important goal.</p></blockquote><p>Location: 1,525</p><blockquote><p>I used to focus on lag measures, such as papers published per year. These measures, however, lacked influence on my day-to-day behavior because there was nothing I could do in the short term that could immediately generate a noticeable change to this long-term metric.</p></blockquote><p>Location: 1,529</p><blockquote><p>Discipline #3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard</p></blockquote><p>Location: 1,538</p><blockquote><p>I kept track of the hours spent in deep work that week with a simple tally of tick marks in that week‚Äôs row.

These stimuli ‚Äúinvoke attention modestly, allowing focused-attention mechanisms a chance to replenish.‚Äù Put another way, when walking through nature, you‚Äôre freed from having to direct your attention, as there are few challenges to navigate (like crowded street crossings), and experience enough interesting stimuli to keep your mind sufficiently occupied to avoid the need to actively aim your attention. This state allows your directed attention resources time to replenish. After fifty minutes of such replenishment, the subjects enjoyed a boost in their concentration.</p></blockquote><p>Location: 1,647</p><blockquote><p>Reason #3: The Work That Evening Downtime Replaces Is Usually Not That Important</p></blockquote><p>Location: 1,670</p><blockquote><p>your commitment to shutting down with a strict shutdown ritual that you use at the end of the workday to maximize the probability that you succeed.

The process should be an algorithm: a series of steps you always conduct, one after another. When you‚Äôre done, have a set phrase you say that indicates completion (to end my own ritual, I say, ‚ÄúShutdown complete‚Äù). This final step sounds cheesy, but it provides a simple cue to your mind that it‚Äôs safe to release work-related thoughts for the rest of the day.</p></blockquote><p>Location: 1,694</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúCommitting to a specific plan for a goal may therefore not only facilitate attainment of the goal but may also free cognitive resources for other pursuits.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>Location: 1,732</p><blockquote><p>The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained.

White recommends that these items be large (and therefore more memorable), like a desk, not a pencil. Next, establish an order in which you look at each of these items in each room. For example, in the front hallway, you might look at the entry mat, then shoes on the floor by the mat, then the bench above the shoes, and so on. Combined this is only fifty items, so add two more items, perhaps in your backyard, to get to the full fifty-two items you‚Äôll later need when connecting these images to all the cards in a standard deck. Practice this mental exercise of walking through the rooms, and looking at items in each room, in a set order. You should find that this type of memorization, because it‚Äôs based on visual images of familiar places and things, will be much easier than the rote memorizing you might remember from your school days. The second step in preparing to memorize a deck of cards is to associate a memorable person or thing with each of the fifty-two possible cards. To make this process easier, try to maintain some logical association between the card and the corresponding image. White provides the example of associating Donald Trump with the King of Diamonds, as diamonds signify wealth. Practice these associations until you can pull a card randomly from the deck and immediately recall the associated image. As before, the use of memorable visual images and associations will simplify the task of forming these connections.</p></blockquote><p>Location: 2,055</p><blockquote><p>I call this way of thinking the any-benefit mind-set, as it identifies any possible benefit as sufficient justification for using a network tool.

As he elaborated: ‚ÄúIf I make hay all summer, I can‚Äôt be doing something else. For example, I now use that time instead to raise boilers [chickens meant for eating]. These generate positive cash flow, because I can sell them. But they also produce manure which I can then use to enhance my soil.‚Äù Then there‚Äôs the equally subtle issue of assessing the secondary value of a purchased bale of hay. As Pritchard explained: ‚ÄúWhen I‚Äôm buying in hay, I‚Äôm trading cash for animal protein, as well as manure (once it passes through the animals‚Äô system), which means I am also getting more nutrients for my land in exchange for my money.

In each room,</p></blockquote><p>Location: 1,966</p><blockquote><p>conjure a clear image of what you see.</p></blockquote><p>Location: 1,966</p><blockquote><p>Once you can easily recall this mental walkthrough of a well-known location, fix in your mind a collection of ten items in each of these rooms. White recommends that these items be large (and therefore more memorable), like a desk, not a pencil. Next, establish an order in which you look at each of these items in each room. For example, in the front hallway, you might look at the entry mat, then shoes on the floor by the mat, then the bench above the shoes, and so on. Combined this is only fifty items, so add two more items, perhaps in your backyard, to get to the full fifty-two items you‚Äôll later need when connecting these images to all the cards in a standard deck. Practice this mental exercise of walking through the rooms, and looking at items in each room, in a set order. You should find that this type of memorization, because it‚Äôs based on visual images of familiar places and things, will be much easier than the rote memorizing you might remember from your school days. The second step in preparing to memorize a deck of cards is to associate a memorable person or thing with each of the fifty-two possible cards. To make this process easier, try to maintain some logical association between the card and the corresponding image. White provides the example of associating Donald Trump with the King of Diamonds, as diamonds signify wealth. Practice these associations until you can pull a card randomly from the deck and immediately recall the associated image. As before, the use of memorable visual images and associations will simplify the task of forming these connections.</p></blockquote><p>Location: 2,055</p><blockquote><p>I call this way of thinking the any-benefit mind-set, as it identifies any possible benefit as sufficient justification for using a network tool.

Here‚Äôs why‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs start by exploring the costs of making hay,‚Äù Pritchard said. ‚ÄúFirst, there‚Äôs the actual cost of fuel, and repairs, and the shed to keep the baler. You also have to pay taxes on it.‚Äù These directly measurable costs, however, were the easy part of his decision. It was instead the ‚Äúopportunity costs‚Äù that required more attention. As he elaborated: ‚ÄúIf I make hay all summer, I can‚Äôt be doing something else. For example, I now use that time instead to raise boilers [chickens meant for eating]. These generate positive cash flow, because I can sell them. But they also produce manure which I can then use to enhance my soil.‚Äù Then there‚Äôs the equally subtle issue of assessing the secondary value of a purchased bale of hay. As Pritchard explained: ‚ÄúWhen I‚Äôm buying in hay, I‚Äôm trading cash for animal protein, as well as manure (once it passes through the animals‚Äô system), which means I am also getting more nutrients for my land in exchange for my money. I‚Äôm also avoiding compacting soils by driving heavy machinery over my ground all summer long.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>Location: 2,100</p><blockquote><p>When making his final decision on the baler, Pritchard moved past the direct monetary costs, which were essentially a wash, and instead shifted his attention to the more nuanced issue of the long-term health of his fields.
