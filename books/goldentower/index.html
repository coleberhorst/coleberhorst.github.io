But fear has no place in a mage’s heart. It was fear of death that set Constantine Madden on his path. When fear rules us, we forget who we truly are. We forget the good we are capable of.”</p></blockquote><p>Location: 551</p><blockquote><p>CALL DREAMED, AND in his dream, he was a grown-up mage in a city he didn’t recognize. He lifted his hands and black lightning — chaos lightning — sparked between them. He felt a sense of surety and overwhelming power. It reminded him of the feeling he’d had when chaos was coursing through his body, except now he knew how to channel it.</p></blockquote><p>Location: 554</p><blockquote><p>The black fire shot from his fingers. It was as if he were Zeus; he could burn the whole world and it would be easy. With movements of his fingers, he guided the destructive fire, striking down other mages as they tried to run. Fire burst from the roofs of buildings. A stone clock tower was burning. He had no counterweight, but it didn’t matter. Nothing mattered. Nothing mattered but power.</p></blockquote><p>Location: 749</p><blockquote><p>“You should have stayed in the void,” Call shouted as he concentrated on pulling the air away from the chaos fire eating away at the trees. But no matter how he pulled, the flames didn’t so much as flicker. They weren’t like regular fire, fed on air. Call wasn’t sure what they fed on, but as his magic flowed toward them, he felt neither heat nor light. If the opposite of chaos was soul, then he feared the fire fed on the substance of the world itself.</p></blockquote><p>Location: 1,022</p><blockquote><p>How did we get in here?” “There is a secret way into every place,” said Warren. “And someone here wants to see you.”</p></blockquote><p>Location: 1,294</p><blockquote><p>This has all been and will be again.</p></blockquote><p>Location: 1,354</p><blockquote><p>fall and laughed…. “I was the Scythe of Souls,” he croaked. “I was the Hooded Kestrel, Ludmilla of Prague, the Scourge of Luxembourg, the Commander of the Void. I was the one who burned down the towers of the world, who parted the sea, and death will die before I do!”</p></blockquote><p>Location: 2,152</p><blockquote><p>But that had been a kid’s wish. His problems now couldn’t be solved by a little magic. Maybe they can be solved by a lot of magic, Aaron said in his head.</p></blockquote><p>Location: 2,423</p><blockquote><p>that. How come I didn’t know you could do that?” “In your past is your future,” Warren said. “And in your future, your past.” Call sighed, realizing there</p></blockquote><p>Location: 2,474</p><blockquote><p>Aaron walked over to Call and hugged him just as tightly as he and Tamara had embraced. “Thank you,” Aaron said, his voice soft. “For everything. For my life. You’re my counterweight, my balance. You always will be.”</p></blockquote><p>Location: 2,512</p><blockquote><p>“Call is my apprentice,” said Rufus. “Alex was my assistant. I can tell you they are both ready. The Fifth Gate, the Gate of Gold, is about doing good works in the world, about genuinely intending to do good. If the gate opens for them and allows them through, then they have learned that lesson. Note that Constantine never walked through that gate; he left the school before he could be asked to do so. If Alex can walk through the Gate of Gold, then I believe we should accept that whatever he’s been forced to do by circumstance, he has a pure heart.”</p></blockquote><p>Location: 2,517</p><blockquote><p>“Very well,” said Master North finally. “I would very much like to see these two tested by the gate. In alchemy, gold is considered to be the purest of metals. The Gate of Gold will test the purity of your hearts. Fail, children, and be locked away forever. There will be no more chances. Go back to your rooms, don your uniforms, and prepare yourselves.”</p></blockquote><p>Location: 2,583</p><blockquote><p>Master Rufus was wearing a tight smile, which relaxed as they came in. “Tamara, Alex, Call. You are ready to pass through the final gate of the Magisterium, the Gate of Balance. Previously, your studies allowed you to walk through control, affinity, creation, and transformation. Long ago, you passed through the First Gate, the Gate of Control, and became a mage in your own right. Now, once you pass through the Gate of Balance, you will be not only a mage but also a member in good standing of the mage world. Passing through the gate demands that you are able to put aside your own desires and emotions for the good of others. If you can see the gate, then you’re ready to be tested. Tamara Rajavi, you first.”</p></blockquote><p>Location: 2,604</p><blockquote><p>It was the eye of a tornado. Images from his life flashed all around him — a cave of ice, his old skateboard, the kitchen at Alastair’s, the Refectory full of students, Master Rufus lecturing, Aaron and Tamara laughing, Havoc as a puppy zipped into Call’s coat. Love for all those things rose up in him, expanded in his chest. He saw the golden tower fall, Alex on his dragon, Drew dangling Aaron over the chaos monster, Anastasia dying, Master Joseph watching him. But he didn’t feel anger. He had bested those things, those people. He had won. The better part of him had won, and there were no memories circling him that weren’t his own. There were no memories of Constantine Madden’s, no memories that belonged to Maugris. Only memories that belonged to him. He knew now who he really was. He was Callum Hunt.</p></blockquote><p>Location: 2,610</p><blockquote><p>The tornado whirled away, and the calm that came after it was almost deafening. He was standing on the other side of the gate with Aaron and Tamara; both of them were grinning at him. They’d both made it. For the moment, the crowd couldn’t see them — though Call could see the mages in the distance, gazing anxiously toward the gate. In a moment the wall of illusion would fall, but for this moment they were together, unseen. “We</p></blockquote></div><ul class="post__social"><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://coleberhorst.github.io/books/goldentower/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?&text=The Golden Tower+https://coleberhorst.github.io/books/goldentower/+by+Holly Black and Cassandra Clare" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&source=The Golden Tower&summary=&url=https://coleberhorst.github.io/books/goldentower/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://coleberhorst.github.io/books/goldentower/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-reddit-alien"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.tumblr.com/share/link?url=https://coleberhorst.github.io/books/goldentower/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-tumblr"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/link/?description=&media=https://coleberhorst.github.io/assets/images/goldentower.jpg&url=https://coleberhorst.github.io/books/goldentower/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="section-padding--none"><div class="grid"><hr class="sep"/></div></div><div class="section-padding"><div class="grid-small"> <span class="post__author">Posted by Holly Black and Cassandra Clare</span></div></div></article></div></main><script src="/assets/js/app.min.js"></script></body></html>
