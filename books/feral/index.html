The problem was, of course, wolves. Although they have lived with caribou for thousands of years, and though caribou seldom feature in their diet,4 wolves have suddenly become an urgent threat to the survival of the species, just as seals suddenly became cod’s nemesis in the 1980s. The committee explained the nature of the problem to the government, which has responded by intensifying its poisoning and shooting of wolves, in order, of course, to protect the natural world.</p></blockquote><p>Location: 218</p><blockquote><p>Even so, as the sheikhs of Saudi Alberta come to dominate federal politics, and as other provincial governments, harried by lobbyists working for destructive interests, feel licensed by the example of Edmonton and Ottawa to accede to their demands, the nature of Canada—in two senses—is changing with terrible speed.

We had seen evidence of the one-sided war some of them were waging against the local Yanomami people, and the physical and cultural collapse of the communities they had invaded. We had heard the gunfire that came from the woods every night, as bandits waylaid the miners, thieves were executed, or men who had struck lucky fought over the gold they had found. In the six months since the main rush began here, 1,700 of the 40,000 miners had been shot dead. Fifteen per cent of the Yanomami had died of disease.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 6</p><blockquote><p>J. G. Ballard reminded us that ‘the suburbs dream of violence. Asleep in their drowsy villas, sheltered by benevolent shopping malls, they wait patiently for the nightmares that will wake them into a more passionate world.’1 We still possess the fear, the courage, the aggression which evolved to see us through our quests and crises, and we still feel the need to exercise them. But our sublimated lives oblige us to invent challenges to replace the horrors of which we have been deprived. We find ourselves hedged by the consequences of our nature, living meekly for fear of provoking or damaging others. ‘Thus conscience does make cowards of us all.’2</p></blockquote><p>Page: 7</p><blockquote><p>They insist that they may swing their fists regardless of whose nose is in the way, almost as if it were a human right.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 7</p><blockquote><p>There was no state of grace, no golden age in which people lived in harmony with nature.

As he approached the friend’s village, he met the girl walking up the track, and changed his plans. They spent the day together, and by nightfall he had persuaded her to elope with him. They waited until everyone in her village was asleep, then slipped out of the compound and ran. The dogs woke, and her brothers set off in pursuit. The two lovers darted through the scrub, but soon after midnight the brothers surrounded them. The girl refused to go home. She told her brothers that if they wanted to talk to her they would have to come to Toronkei’s village. The brothers returned to their compound, and Toronkei and his fiancée reached his manyatta just before dawn. Her father was furious, but there was little he could do: his daughter would not be dissuaded. Toronkei had opened negotiations: the father had demanded a bride price of five cows and 10,000 shillings. Toronkei’s parents were trying to talk him down. The girl came from a rich family, and the deal would be tough.

I sat in the hut drinking milk and greeting the procession of young men who came in to pay their respects to him, troubled by a sense of inadequacy. As I watched the warriors sitting hand in hand on the pallet, and the young woman looking tenderly at her husband, I was struck by a thought so clear and resonant that it was as if a bell had been rung beside my ear. Had I, as an embryo, been given a choice between my life and his–knowing that, whichever I accepted, I would adapt to it and make myself comfortable within it–I would have taken his.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 44</p><blockquote><p>In 1753, Benjamin Franklin, writing to the English botanist Peter Collinson, made the following complaint: When an Indian Child has been brought up among us, taught our language and habituated to our Customs, yet if he goes to see his relations and make one Indian Ramble with them, there is no perswading him ever to return, and that this is not natural to them merely as Indians, but as men, is plain from this, that when white persons of either sex have been taken prisoners young by the Indians, and lived a while among them, tho’ ransomed by their Friends, and treated with all imaginable tenderness to prevail with them to stay among the English, yet in a Short time they become disgusted with our manner of life, and the care and pains that are necessary to support it, and take the first good Opportunity of escaping again into the Woods, from whence there is no reclaiming them.1</p></blockquote><p>Page: 45</p><blockquote><p>Elopement with indigenous peoples was seen by the colonial authorities as a major threat to their attempts to subjugate the New World. When, in 1612, young men started defecting from Jamestown, the first sustained English settlement in North America, the deputy governor, Thomas Dale, hunted them down. According to a contemporary account, Some he apointed to be hanged. Some burned. Some to be broken upon wheles, others to be staked and some to be shott to death.2 The severity of these sanctions hints at the strength of the attraction. Despite the penalties, Europeans continued to defect, or to remain with the indigenous peoples who had captured them in war, until the Native Americans had been so reduced and broken that there was no longer a life to be drawn to. In 1785, Hector de Crèvecoeur remarked upon the fierce determination of European children to stay with the Indian communities that had kidnapped them, when their parents came to collect them during periods of peace. . . . those whose more advanced ages permitted them to recollect their fathers and mothers, absolutely refused to follow them, and ran to their adopted parents for protection against the effusions of love their unhappy real parents lavished on them! Incredible as this may appear, I have heard it asserted in a thousand instances, among persons of credit. In the village of ——-, where I purpose to go, there lived, about fifteen years ago, an Englishman and a Swede . . . They were grown to the age of men when they were taken; they happily escaped the great punishment of war captives, and were obliged to marry the Squaws who had saved their lives by adoption. By the force of habit, they became at last thoroughly naturalised to this wild course of life. While I was there, their friends sent them a considerable sum of money to ransom themselves with.

In Victorian Britain, large numbers of people believed that the dead were appearing to them and communicating with them. They saw ghosts, heard voices and imagined they could exchange messages with the departed through séances and table-turning. The Victorians were obsessed by death. Walk around any ancient graveyard and you will read the tragic story of that era: children and spouses snatched away, sometimes, in the epidemics that raged through the crowded cities, within days of each other. Ours was a nation in perpetual mourning. The notion that the dead could return in this life must have been almost as comforting as the belief that we would be reunited with them in the afterlife. Today reports of contact with the dead are less prevalent. As the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union gripped the world’s imagination, sightings of UFOs and aliens, almost unknown in previous eras, multiplied.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 60</p><blockquote><p>Could it be that illusory big cats also answer an unmet need? As our lives have become tamer and more predictable, as the abundance and diversity of nature have declined, as our physical challenges have diminished to the point at which the greatest trial of strength and ingenuity we face is opening a badly designed packet of nuts, could these imaginary creatures have brought us something we miss? Perhaps the beasts many people now believe are lurking in the dark corners of the land inject into our lives a thrill that can otherwise be delivered only by artificial means. Perhaps they reawaken old genetic memories of conflict and survival, memories which must incorporate encounters–possibly the most challenging encounters our ancestors faced–with large predatory cats. They hint at an unexpressed wish for lives wilder and fiercer than those we now lead.

A keystone species is one that has a larger impact on its environment than its numbers alone would suggest. This impact creates the conditions which allow other species to live there. European beavers, unlike the North American species, build only small dams, but the changes they make to the flow of rivers, the branches and twigs they drag into the water, the burrows they excavate, the shallow ditches they create as they forage on the land and their felling of some of the riverside trees transforms their surroundings. They create habitats for water voles, otters, ducks, frogs, fish and insects. In Wyoming, where admittedly the ponds they make are larger than those in Europe, streams where beavers live harbour seventy-five times as many waterbirds as those without.20</p></blockquote><p>Page: 82</p><blockquote><p>Our rivers, like the land, have suffered from intensive management.

The process is the outcome. The main aim of rewilding is to restore to the greatest extent possible… Some highlights have been hidden or truncated due to export limits.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 84</p><blockquote><p>the scientific principle behind rewilding is restoring what ecologists call trophic diversity. Trophic means relating to food and feeding. Restoring trophic diversity means enhancing the number of opportunities for animals, plants and other creatures to feed on each other; to rebuild the broken strands in the web of life. It means expanding the web both vertically and horizontally, increasing the number of trophic levels (top predators, middle predators, plant eaters, plants,… Some highlights have been hidden or truncated due to export limits.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 84</p><blockquote><p>One of the most fascinating discoveries in modern ecology is an abundance of trophic cascades. A trophic cascade occurs when the animals at the top of the food chain–the top predators–change the numbers not just of their prey, but also of species with which they have no direct connection. Their impacts cascade down the food chain, in some cases radically changing the ecosystem, the landscape and even the chemical composition of the soil and the atmosphere. The best-known example is the dramatic change that followed the reintroduction of wolves to the Yellowstone National Park in the United States. Seventy years after they had been exterminated, wolves were released into the park in 1995. When they arrived, many of the streamsides and riversides were almost bare, closely cropped by the high population of red deer (which in North America, confusingly, are called elk*5). But as soon as the wolves arrived, this began to change. It was not just that they sharply reduced the number of deer, but they also altered their prey’s behaviour. The deer avoided the places–particularly the valleys and gorges–where they could be caught most easily.32 In some places, trees on the riverbanks, until then constantly suppressed by browsing, quintupled in height in just six years.33 The trees shaded and cooled the water and provided cover for fish and other animals,34 changing the wildlife… Some highlights have been hidden or truncated due to export limits.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 87</p><blockquote><p>Hunting by humans might also have transformed the environment of Australia. Before people arrived on that continent, it teemed with</p></blockquote><p>Page: 88</p><blockquote><p>monsters. Among them was a spiny anteater the size of a pig; a giant herbivore a bit like a wombat, which weighed two tonnes; a marsupial tapir as big as a horse; a ten-foot kangaroo; a marsupial lion with opposable thumbs and a stronger bite than any other known mammal, which could prop itself up on its tail in order to stand on its hindlegs and slash with its tremendous claws; a horned tortoise eight feet long; a monitor lizard much bigger than the Nile crocodile. Most of these species, alongside many other marvellous beasts, disappeared between 40,000 and 50,000 years ago. At roughly the same time, the dense rainforests which covered much of that continent began to be replaced with the grass and scrubby trees which populate much of the outback today.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 88</p><blockquote><p>example, in many parts of Africa, people have killed lions and leopards in the belief that this will enhance their chances of survival and (among early European hunters) boost the herds of game. But one result has been an explosion in the population of olive baboons. They inflict such damage on crops and livestock that children have to be taken out of school to fend them off.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 89</p><blockquote><p>Similarly, when conservationists in Florida sought to protect sea turtles by culling the raccoons which eat their eggs, they found that it caused the opposite effect. More turtle eggs were lost, as the raccoons were no longer eating the ghost crabs which also preyed on them.55</p></blockquote><p>Page: 89</p><blockquote><p>Trophic cascades might once have dominated most ecosystems. The old belief among ecologists that natural systems were controlled only from the bottom up–that the abundance of plants controls the abundance of plant eaters, which controls the abundance of meat eaters–arose from the fact that many of the systems they were studying had already been greatly changed by people, not least through the reduction or extinction of top predators. Much of the richness and complexity–the trophic diversity–of these foodwebs was lost before it was recorded. We live in a shadowland, a dim, flattened relic of what there once was, of what there could be again.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 90</p><blockquote><p>The fells contract, regroup in starker forms; Dusk tightens on them, as the wind gets up And stretches hungrily: tensed at the nape, The coarse heath bristles like a living pelt.

But until very recently (in geological terms) they lived in climates much colder than north-western Europe is today. Until around 40,000 years ago, the straight-tusked elephant (Elephas antiquus), closely related to the Asian elephant, roamed across much of Europe.1 The woolly mammoth, which had an entirely different ecology, grazing on cold steppes (rather than browsing, like the straight-tusked elephant, in temperate forests) lasted longer: one relict population, isolated from human hunters in the fastness of Wrangel Island off the north coast of Siberia, survived until the Bronze Age.2 Three species of rhinoceros–the woolly, the Merck’s and the narrow-nosed–lived in Europe at the same time as humans. Until roughly 40,000 years ago, Russia was haunted by two monstrous beasts, Elasmotherium sibiricum and Elasmotherium caucasicum. They were humpbacked rhinos the size of elephants, eight feet to the crest, weighing perhaps five tonnes. Elephants roamed across Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas; rhinos never populated the Americas, but they lived throughout the Old World. Across the past 50,000 years the range and variety of these species have shrunk as humans have hunted them. They were exterminated first in Europe; then (in the case of elephants) in the Americas; then in the Middle East and North Africa; then in most of Asia; eventually in most of Africa. The animals conservationists are now desperately trying–and often failing–to save are the last, tiny populations of creatures which once dominated most of the earth’s surface, so recently that we can almost stretch out our fingers and touch them.

It is not, as the previous chapter might have suggested, the desire to control floods, or reduce erosion or hinder the spread of disease, though all these might be useful side-effects. My reasons arise from my delight in the marvels of nature, its richness and its limitless capacity to surprise; from the sense of freedom, of the thrill that comes from roaming in a landscape or seascape without knowing what I might see next, what might loom from the woods or water, what might be watching me without my knowledge.

Deep vegetation on the hills absorbs rain when it falls, and releases it gradually, delivering a steady supply of water to the lowlands.

When I asked her officials how this statement could be justified, they sent me two long scientific reports. I read them and discovered that they said the opposite of what the minister and her department had claimed. One of them revealed that it is not tree planting but overgrazing by sheep which has reduced the amount of carbon in the soil in the Welsh uplands.†7 Even plantation forestry, which creates much greater disturbance of the soil than allowing native trees to spread, causes no demonstrable carbon loss.42 The other told me that in all the situations it modelled, planting trees on grasslands increased the amount of carbon in the soil.43</p></blockquote><p>Page: 165</p><blockquote><p>Subsidies are not the only means by which we pay for grazing in the hills.

There’s not the same need to use our brains now.’ Dafydd was teaching himself the old Welsh counting system. Based on multiples of 10, 15 and 20, it was designed by shepherds for counting animals. ‘You can juggle the numbers between the fingers of your two hands, totting the blocks on one, the individuals on the other. It allows you to count very quickly. In the new numbers, you can’t count fast enough to match the speed that sheep run at. So you have to slow them down through the gate. From the 1970s onwards, Welsh learners were taught the decimal system. I can see the sense in that, but we’ve also lost something.’ He could, Delyth told me, judge the weight of a sheep to within a kilo; they had stopped using the scales as he always got it right, and it was quicker to weigh them by eye.

We don’t know what North America would have looked like with no humans at all, but we do know it didn’t look like that under the ‘Indians’. Bone excavations show that passenger pigeons were not even common in the 1400s. ‘Indians’ specifically targeted pregnant deer and wild turkeys before they laid eggs, to eliminate competition for maize and tree nuts.

But Congress overlooked the fact that it had been settled for some 11,000 years, and appears still to have been used by the Crow, the Shoshone Tukadika and the Blackfoot.*6 They too were transformed into trespassers in the park and were eventually removed therefrom.

They wanted to create a real one.34 Like the scientists in Jurassic Park, they sought to resurrect this animal, as well as the ancestral horse, from genetic material; but in this case the material carried by the wild animal’s descendants. As Konrad Lorenz hoped to do with human beings, they tried to strip cattle of their domestic traits so that the purified, uncivilized beast within could break, pawing and roaring, out of its degenerate husk. As was so often the case with the declarations the Nazis made, the success the Heck brothers claimed for their attempts at genetic reversal was exaggerated. They maintained that, in the space of just twelve years, they had re-created the aurochs.

In 2002, at two world summits, governments promised to protect at least 10 per cent of the world’s seas by 2012.55 In 2003 the World Parks Congress called for at least 20 or 30 per cent of every habitat at sea to become strict reserves by the same date.56 Despite the creation of a few very large conservation areas, such as the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, covering 350,000 square kilometres, at the time of writing less than 2 per cent of the world’s seas has any form of protection,57 and only in some of these places is fishing wholly excluded.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 250</p><blockquote><p>Like the Kraken in Tennyson’s poem, the suppressed life of the sea awaits only its chance to re-emerge. Not all missing populations can be restored. Some of the lifeforms being wrecked by perhaps the most destructive fishing operation of all–the trawling of the deep seamounts–take thousands of years to grow.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 250</p><blockquote><p>There should also be restrictions on the kind of equipment used in places where fishing continues, on the capacity of fishing boats and the time they spend at sea and on their freedom to discard the fish they do not want to keep.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 251</p><blockquote><p>Fishermen tend to resist marine reserves before they are created, then to support them once they have been established, as their catches rise, often far beyond expectations. In the seas surrounding the Apo reserve that I mentioned a moment ago, for example, the catch swiftly rose to ten times its previous level, and has stayed that way since.67 There have been similar results in, for example, fisheries off Japan, New Zealand, Newfoundland and Kenya.68</p></blockquote><p>Page: 251</p><blockquote><p>Marine protection is so cheap and the results so lucrative that, the Royal Commission calculated, just a 2 or 3 per cent increase in the fish catch in the North Sea would pay for the protection of 30 per cent of its area.69 The returns are more likely to rise by 200 or 300 per cent.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 251</p><blockquote><p>A report by the New Economics Foundation suggests that the failure to protect fish stocks properly costs the European Union some 82,000 jobs and €3 billion a year.70 Marine rewilding not only offers the best chance of protecting much of the life of the seas, but also the best chance of protecting the livelihoods of those who harvest it. The weight of fish landed worldwide peaked in 1988. Despite attempts by Chinese officials to inflate their production figures, it has been declining since then by half a million tonnes a year.71 The surest means by which this could be reversed is the creation of a network of large marine reserves.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 253</p><blockquote><p>There is one method–scallop dredging–that is restricted in some parts of the Special Area of Conservation. With the possible exception of dynamite fishing, it would be hard to devise a more effective means of destroying both living creatures and their habitats. Scallop dredges operate by raking through the seabed with long metal teeth, dislodging the shellfish from the sediments and trapping them in a net whose underside is made of chain mail. The teeth rip through any sedentary creature in their path, as well as the fish, crabs and lobsters unable to escape in time.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 256</p><blockquote><p>By seeking out the pockets of land and water that might inspire and guide an attempt to revive the natural world, I had revived my own life. Long before my dreams of restoration had been realized, the untamed spirit I had sought to invoke had already returned. By equipping myself with knowledge of the past while imagining a rawer and richer future, I had banished my ecological boredom.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 260</p><blockquote><p>Had the sun not been shining, had the sky and waves been cut from slate, not crystal, the sea that now looked inviting to me would have appeared forbidding, perhaps terrifying. But we are simple creatures, and a sprinkling of stardust dazzles our senses. Had the quest not been so arousing, had the ride been any less thrilling, I might have challenged the grounds on which I continued to head out to sea. This is a roundabout way of telling you that I failed to notice that a journey which had begun foolishly was now progressing towards madness:</p></blockquote><p>Page: 265</p><blockquote><p>I felt a curious mixture of shame and triumph. I had confronted the casual power of nature and–no, not won, no one ever wins–survived.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 268</p><blockquote><p>The mountain appeared to snag the star then to drag it down into the earth like an ant lion. A puff of indigo cloud, like cannon smoke, hung against a sheet of flaming cirrus. I looked around the bay. Though the light was fading, I could see the whole crescent. To the south was the gently rising plateau of the Cambrian Desert, dissolving into the suggestion of Pembrokeshire, where a few lights now glimmered.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 291</p><blockquote><p>I would question the idea that Lawrence invites us to discard rationality, on the grounds that we do not have a great deal to discard (as the work of researchers such as Jonathan Haidt and Antonio Damasio shows). What he invites us to discard, and what I think Eagleton and Bertrand Russell are talking about, is universalism. If blood and culture are allowed to outweigh the consistent application of universalist principles (in particular the golden rule), this can become a licence to trample on other people.</p></blockquote></div><ul class="post__social"><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://localhost:4000/books/feral/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?&text=Feral: Rewilding the Land, the Sea, and Human Life+http://localhost:4000/books/feral/+by+George Monbiot" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&source=Feral: Rewilding the Land, the Sea, and Human Life&summary=&url=http://localhost:4000/books/feral/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http://localhost:4000/books/feral/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-reddit-alien"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.tumblr.com/share/link?url=http://localhost:4000/books/feral/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-tumblr"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/link/?description=&media=http://localhost:4000/assets/images/feral.jpg&url=http://localhost:4000/books/feral/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="section-padding--none"><div class="grid"><hr class="sep"/></div></div><div class="section-padding"><div class="grid-small"> <span class="post__author">Posted by George Monbiot</span></div></div></article></div></main><script src="/assets/js/app.min.js"></script></body></html>
