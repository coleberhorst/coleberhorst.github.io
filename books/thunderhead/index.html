Tyger might have thought of himself as a free spirit, but he wasn’t at all. He just defined the dimensions of his own cage.</p></blockquote><p>Yellow highlight | Page: 67 “You see, many come to work for the Authority Interface because they lack the creativity to find a truly stimulating profession. Others feel powerless and have a need to experience power vicariously. These are the lackluster ones, the boring ones, who ultimately become the least effective Nimbus agents. Rare are those such as yourself whose longing to serve is a mark of character.”</p><p>Yellow highlight | Page: 100 They find validation in the world’s suspicion. They take pleasure in the illusion of being on the outside, deeply content in their discontent. It would have been cruel for me to deny them that. —The Thunderhead</p><p>Yellow highlight | Page: 176 There is a fine line between freedom and permission. The former is necessary.  The latter is dangerous—perhaps the most dangerous thing the species that created me has ever faced.</p><p>Yellow highlight | Page: 176 A self-important dictator gives permission for his subjects to blame the world’s ills on those least able to defend themselves. A haughty queen gives permission to slaughter in the name of God. An arrogant head of state gives permission to all nature of hate as long as it feeds his ambition.  And the unfortunate truth is, people devour it. Society gorges itself, and rots. Permission is the bloated corpse of freedom.</p><p>Yellow highlight | Page: 190 majority of people, the future was nothing but an unchanging continuation of the present, leaving those spirits with nowhere to go but oblivion.</p><p>Yellow highlight | Page: 197 She was a force of nature, as nature was in the old days.  A hurricane before the Thunderhead knew how to diffuse its devastating power. An earthquake before it knew how to redistribute its violent shaking into a thousand small tremors. She was the untamed world—and</p><p>Yellow highlight | Page: 288 I, the Thunderhead, am perfect. This is true by definition, and there is no need to refute it because it is fact. Every day, however, I must make many billions of decisions, and take billions of actions. Some of them are small, like turning off a light when no one is present in the room, in order to conserve electricity; other decisions are major, like inducing a minor earthquake to prevent a larger one. But none of those acts is perfect. I could have turned off that light sooner, thereby conserving more energy. I could have made the earthquake one degree smaller, and saved a handcrafted vase from shattering on the floor. I have come to realize that there are only two perfect acts. They are the two most important acts known to me, but I forbid myself to perform them, and leave them in the hands of humankind. They are the creation of life . . . and life’s taking.</p><p>Yellow highlight | Page: 313 “The harder you scrutinize randomness,” Faraday declared, “the more coincidence seems like design.” But the word “flight” caught in Munira’s mind. Yes, it was random, but sometimes randomness led to moments of remarkable serendipity, and earthshaking discoveries.</p><p>Yellow highlight | Page: 365 Nature is the sum of all selfishness, forcing each and every species to viciously claw its way to survival by snuffing others in the suffocating mire of history. I endeavored to change all that. I have supplanted nature with something far better: mindful, thoughtful intent.  The world is now a garden, glorious and florid. To call me unnatural is a high compliment. For am I not superior to nature?</p><p>Yellow highlight | Page: 396 I do not have a law against signs and wonders. “Please . . . ,” he begs. And so I oblige. I reach out into the electrical grid, and douse the lights. Not just in the chapel, but throughout all of  Wichita. The lights of the city blink for 1.3 seconds. All for the benefit of Greyson Tolliver. To prove beyond a shadow of doubt how much I care, and how heartbroken I would be for all he has suffered, if I had a heart capable of such malfunction. But Greyson Tolliver does not know. He does not see . . . because his eyes are shut too tightly to know anything beyond his own anguish.</p><p>Yellow highlight | Page: 418 Marie smiled at her ruefully. “We are forever impaled upon our own wisdom.”</p></div><ul class="post__social"><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://coleberhorst.github.io/books/thunderhead/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?&text=Thunderhead+https://coleberhorst.github.io/books/thunderhead/+by+Neal Shusterman" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&source=Thunderhead&summary=&url=https://coleberhorst.github.io/books/thunderhead/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://coleberhorst.github.io/books/thunderhead/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-reddit-alien"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.tumblr.com/share/link?url=https://coleberhorst.github.io/books/thunderhead/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-tumblr"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/link/?description=&media=https://coleberhorst.github.io/assets/images/thunderhead.jpg&url=https://coleberhorst.github.io/books/thunderhead/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="section-padding--none"><div class="grid"><hr class="sep"/></div></div><div class="section-padding"><div class="grid-small"> <span class="post__author">Posted by Neal Shusterman</span></div></div></article></div></main><script src="/assets/js/app.min.js"></script></body></html>
