The bottom line: Money can’t make you happy if your increased wealth brings increased expectations.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 12</p><blockquote><p>Kurt Vonnegut used to recount a conversation he had with fellow author Joseph Heller (Vonnegut published this anecdote as a poem in the New Yorker). The two writers were at a party thrown by a billionaire when Vonnegut joked, “How does it feel to know that our host makes more in one day than Catch-22 [Heller’s best-known work] has made in its entire history?” Heller responded, “I’ve got something he can never have. I’ve got Enough.”</p></blockquote><p>Page: 14</p><blockquote><p>Ramit Sethi popularized the concept of conscious spending in his book I Will Teach You to Be Rich (Workman Publishing, 2009). The idea is to spend with intent, deliberately deciding where to direct your money instead of spending impulsively. Sethi argues that it’s okay to spend $5,000 a year on shoes — if that spending is aligned with your goals and values and you’ve made a conscious choice to spend this way (as opposed to spending compulsively — see Curbing Compulsive Spending).</p></blockquote><p>Page: 15</p><blockquote><p>If you’re new to conscious spending, try asking yourself the following questions: Did I receive value from this equal to the amount I spent? In other words, did you get your money’s worth? You already know that $100 spent on one thing isn’t always as good as $100 spent on another. Conscious spending is about striving to get the most bang for your buck. Is this spending aligned with my goals and values? Conscious spending means prioritizing: putting your money toward the things you love — and cutting costs mercilessly on the things you don’t. If you’re happy with the coffee at the office, then don’t waste your money at Starbucks. But if your extra-hot nonfat caramel latte is the highlight of your day, then buy the latte! Spend only on the things that matter to you.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 16</p><blockquote><p>Once you define Enough, you gain a sense of freedom. You’re no longer caught up in the rat race and have time to pursue your passions. You can surround yourself with family and friends, and rediscover the importance of social capital — the value you get from making personal connections with people in your community (see Social Capital). And because you no longer feel compelled to buy more Stuff, you can use your money to save for things that truly matter.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 18</p><blockquote><p>Psychologists generally agree that a life well-lived is rich in: Security. It’s hard to be happy when you’re constantly worrying about how to pay the bills. If you have money, you don’t have to worry about those things. (But, as you now know, you don’t have to be rich to be happy.) By living below your means and avoiding debt, you can gain some financial control over your life. Relationships. True wealth comes from relationships, not from dollars and cents. Wealthy or poor, people with five or more close friends are more apt to describe themselves as happy than those with fewer. A long-term, loving partnership goes hand in hand with this. And as you’ll learn later (Social Capital), social capital can be worth as much as financial capital. Experiences. As explained in the Note on How Money Affects Happiness, memories tend to grow more positive with time, but Stuff usually drops in value — both actual value and perceived value. As Gregory Karp writes in The 1-2-3 Money Plan (FT Press, 2009), “Experiences appreciate, assets depreciate.” And in Your Money and Your Brain (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2008), Jason Zweig notes, “Doing and being are better than having.”</p></blockquote><p>Page: 19</p><blockquote><p>Prioritize. Spend on the things that make you happiest. There’s nothing wrong with buying things you’ll use and enjoy — that’s the purpose of money. If you’re spending less than you earn, meeting your needs, and saving for the future, you can afford things that make life easier and more enjoyable. (For another way to prioritize, see the box on Living a Rich Life.) Stay healthy. There’s a strong tie between health and happiness. Anyone who’s experienced a prolonged injury or illness knows just how emotionally — and financially — devastating it can be. Eat right, exercise, and get enough sleep (Your Body: The Missing Manual has loads of tips on how to do all those things). Don’t compare yourself to others. Financially, psychologically, and socially, keeping up with the Joneses is a trap. You’ll always have friends who are wealthier and more successful in their careers than you. Focus on your own life and goals. Limit media exposure. Mass media — especially TV — tries to persuade you that happiness depends on things you don’t really need and can’t afford. Studies have found that watching lots of TV can influence your levels of materialism — how much you think you need to be happy. Simplify. The average Joe believes that materialism is the path to happiness — but the average Joe is wrong. Research shows that materialism actually leads to unhappiness and dissatisfaction. By simplifying your life and reducing the amount of Stuff you own (or want to own), you’ll save money and be happier. Help others. Altruism is one of the best ways to boost your happiness. It may seem counter-intuitive (and maybe even a little self-serving), but donating to your church or favorite charity is a proven method for brightening your day. Embrace routine. Emerson wrote, “A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds,” but there’s evidence that some consistency is conducive to contentment. In Happier (McGraw-Hill, 2007), Tal Ben-Shahar recommends building routines around the things you love: reading, walking, gaming, knitting, whatever. Because it can be difficult to make the time for these activities, he argues that we should make rituals out of them. If you enjoy biking, make a ritual out of riding to the park every evening, for example. (See the box below for tips on finding time for what you love.) Pursue meaningful goals. As you’ll learn in the next chapter, the road to wealth is paved with goals, and the same is true of the road to happiness. But for a goal to be worthwhile, it has to be related to your values and interests — it has to add something</p></blockquote><p>Page: 20</p><blockquote><p>Imagine you have an empty jar, a collection of a few large rocks, and several handfuls of gravel. Your task is to put all the large and small rocks into the jar. One approach would be to pile all the gravel first, but doing so would leave room for only one or two of the large rocks; you wouldn’t get everything to fit. Switch your approach and put the large rocks in first, and you’ll find that the gravel will all fit nicely around the empty space. If a bit of gravel doesn’t fit at the end, you’ve not lost much. Let too many little things take priority, and there never seems to be time for the big things. Consider the Big Rocks to be really important things you want to accomplish in life, the things that define you. Get the big things in first, work on the right projects and priorities, and let the little stuff fit in around the edges. Let your Big Rocks be non-negotiable priorities in your weekly calendar — and learn to say “no” when other things begin to intrude. Then fit those other things in where you can.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 25</p><blockquote><p>With goals come tradeoffs, but having goals makes those tradeoffs easier to bear. If you’re saving 25% of your take-home pay so you can quit your crummy job and start your own business, it’s easier to pass up a ski weekend with friends because you know doing so will help you reach your goal that much sooner.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 27</p><blockquote><p>Positive. Positive goals (where you’re attempting to reach a target, like saving for a vacation) yield better results than negative goals (where you’re trying to avoid something, like cutting out your daily latte). Flexible. Your goals will evolve over time. As your priorities change, your goals should, too. This isn’t an excuse to abandon a difficult goal or to quit just because you failed to meet it. But if you lose your job, say, you need to be willing to adapt your goals to take your new circumstances into account. Activity-oriented. Goals that involve doing rather than getting make people happier. Pursuing experiential goals will bring you more fulfillment than obtaining more Stuff.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 28</p><blockquote><p>One way to multitask without becoming overwhelmed is to work on one short-term goal, one mid-term goal, and one long-term goal at the same time. If your long-term goal is to save for a down payment on a house, for example, you might also have a mid-term goal of saving for a holiday in Hawaii, and a short-term goal of asking your boss for a raise.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 32</p><blockquote><p>Find out exactly how much the item costs. Designate an envelope for saving the money, and write your target sum on the outside. Find a picture of the item in a magazine or online, or take the photo yourself. Fasten the picture to the envelope. Commit to a definite schedule for adding money to the envelope — $10 a week, say, or $50 every paycheck. Write that commitment on the envelope, too. Feed the envelope according to your schedule. Each time you add money to the envelope, you’ll see the picture of the item you want, setting up a positive feedback loop that feeds your desire. To supercharge this technique, Brem suggests Photoshoping a picture of yourself with the thing you’re saving for so that it reinforces the positive buzz. (You can also use this method with targeted savings accounts, which are described on Targeted Savings Accounts.)</p></blockquote><p>Page: 34</p><blockquote><p>Setbacks are disheartening, but remember: Failure is okay.

Internal trolls include: Self-defeating thoughts and behaviors: “I can’t do this — it’s too difficult”, “I’m not smart enough”, “It’s too much work”, “I don’t deserve to have money.” Procrastination: “I’ll start next week”, “I’ll worry about this later”, “I can start saving next month.” For more on how to beat the procrastination habit, see http://tinyurl.com/GRS-putoff. Rationalization: “Buying just one pair of shoes won’t blow my budget”, “I’m out with my friends — I should have fun”, “I deserve to reward myself for how well I’ve been doing lately.” Barriers: “I don’t know how to open a Roth IRA”, “It’s too much bother to set up automatic deposits”, “Sure I could shop around for lower rates, but I don’t like talking on the phone.” (There’s more on how to knock down the barriers that hold you back at http://tinyurl.com/GRS-barriers.) Most internal trolls are a product of self-doubt and can be best combated through exercise, discipline, positive social interaction, and a healthy diet.

Let your potential employer decide whether you’re the right candidate, and then talk about money. The same is true of raises — discuss them after you have your performance review. (The next section has more about asking for a raise.) Let them go first. It’s hard to come out ahead by naming a number, so let your employer suggest a salary. Lots of people find it awkward to evade direct questions about salary history. For these folks, Chapman has posted a short video that explains how to answer questions about salary expectations: http://salarynegotiations.com/Video.htm. (Also see Penelope Trunk’s advice on the subject: http://tinyurl.com/BCsalary.) When you hear their offer, repeat the top value — and then stop talking. “The most likely outcome of this silence is a raise,” Chapman writes. This technique buys you some time to think while putting pressure on the employer. For more on this step, check out Chapman’s video about it: http://tinyurl.com/theflinch. Counter their offer with a researched response. Next, make a counter-offer based on what you know about yourself, the market, and the company. This means you have to do some research beforehand so you know the reasonable salary range for the position. Clinch the deal — then deal some more. Finally, lock in the offer, and then negotiate additional benefits like extra vacation days or a company car. This is like agreeing on the price of a car before you negotiate the value of your trade-in (see Sell your old car separately).</p></blockquote><p>Page: 107</p><blockquote><p>Make your case. Draw up a list of ways you’ve helped the company, and try to state these achievements in dollar terms, if you can. For example: “By creating the new maintenance schedule for our delivery trucks, I’ve saved the business $10,000 over the past 3 months.” Be honest and don’t exaggerate. Try to think of things from the company’s point of view — nobody’s going to give you a raise just because you need extra cash. Do your homework. Before you meet with your boss, have a target salary in mind. Use sites like PayScale.com, SalaryScout.com, and GlassDoor.com to research the going rate for similar jobs in your area. (Better yet, ask around to see what colleagues at other firms are earning.) Seize the moment. The best time to ask for a raise is after a strong performance review or after your boss gives you new responsibilities. You’re not entitled to a raise simply for coming to work every day, but you’ve got a right to request one if you’re doing good work. Don’t complain. Be positive and professional: Emphasize your strengths and accomplishments, and give examples of how you’ve helped the company. Don’t gripe about your workload or other employees. Follow up. After your meeting, be sure to follow up on any promises your boss made. Get the details of the raise in writing, and keep an eye on your paycheck to make sure it goes up when it’s supposed to.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 108</p><blockquote><p>Improve your skills. Even if you didn’t get a raise this year, you can increase your odds of future salary bumps by learning new things. Attend training sessions, go to seminars and conferences, and get certified in job-related skills. (Many companies will even pay for your classes.) You can then use your new skills at your current job — or to help you find a new one. Ask for non-monetary rewards. If there’s no room in your company’s budget for a raise, ask for other compensation, like an extra week of vacation, a more flexible schedule, or a better parking space.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 109</p><blockquote><p>Tell your boss first. Respect the chain of command: Talk to your manager before telling your buddies you’re leaving. Be ready for a counter-offer. If you’re a valuable part of the company’s plans, they may try to get you to stay. Be prepared for this, and know what you’re going to say. (This is one reason it’s important not to lie when resigning: If the company offers to fix the things you claimed were wrong but they aren’t your real reasons for leaving, you could end up in an awkward position.) Leave in good standing. As tempting as it is to mentally check out before you’re done working for your old company, resist that urge. If you said you’d stay 2 more weeks, work during those 2 weeks. If you don’t, you put the company in a tough spot and make yourself look bad. You never know when you’ll need a reference from a former boss or find yourself working with former coworkers again.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 110</p><blockquote><p>On The Money: Informational Interviews Finding a job can be tough. Competition is fierce, and even if you’ve got the right skills, it’s challenging to make yourself known to the right people. Informational interviews are a way to get an edge on your competition. These aren’t the same as job interviews — they’re an opportunity to learn more about a career or company. The first step in setting up one of these interviews is to find people with jobs that interest you. Prepare a simple list of questions to make sure you get the info you need when you contact these folks. It may help calm your nerves to approach the interview as if you were a reporter: Pretend you’re gathering facts for a news story. The cardinal rule of informational interviews is don’t ask for a job. If you tell somebody you’re just gathering info but then turn the meeting into a job interview, you’re just going to make her angry. (If she thinks you’re a promising candidate and she has a position available, she’ll contact you.) Here are some more guidelines: Ask politely. If the subject agrees to an interview, set a time and a date. If she’s not up for such an interview, respect her boundaries. Be prepared. Dress appropriately, be punctual, do your homework about the company or field, and be ready to ask intelligent, relevant questions. Listen. Ask open-ended questions, and then let the subject talk about herself and the company. Good questions include “What’s your typical workday like?” and “How is your company different from its competitors?” Take notes. You’re conducting this interview to learn more about a possible career, so write things down and ask follow-up questions. Be brief. Keep track of time. Don’t rush, but don’t overstay your welcome. Afterward, remember to send an email or hand-written note to thank the person for taking time to meet with you.

Just as a budget is important for your personal finances, a business plan is key to entrepreneurial success. If your business is small, the plan can be as simple as a list of goals. But if you’re looking for outside funding or hope to take over the world, your plan needs to be as detailed as possible. You can find free sample business plans at www.Bplans.com. Don’t quit your day job — at least not at first. If possible, start by going solo on evenings and weekends to get a feel for your business and find out if you really want to pursue it full time. You may discover your new gig isn’t what you’d hoped for. Find advisors you trust. A new business is uncharted territory, so it’s really helpful to have guides. Heed the advice of your mentors, and find a good lawyer and accountant and follow their instructions. Play by the rules. Some small-business owners strike out on their own because they’re mavericks. This independence may make them think they can cut corners by not filling out paperwork or filing taxes, but shortcuts like these put everything at risk. It’s easier to do things right the first time than to sort out a mess later. Keep business and personal accounts separate. Don’t mingle work and personal funds; open a checking account specifically for the business. Then document everything that enters and leaves that account. Keep costs low. Do what you can to keep your overhead down. For example, don’t spend $1,000 on a fancy Aeron chair when you can pick up a decent desk chair from Goodwill for five bucks. You’ll be less stressed and have better odds of success if you don’t have a lot of bills dragging you down. Be willing to spend on training. Buy the books and manuals you need and pay for classes. Training like this is a necessary business expense, not a luxury. Keep good records. Business will be slow at first, so it won’t seem like a big deal that you keep receipts in a shoebox and don’t have a filing system. But in time, you’ll be flooded with paperwork. Get organized from the start to prevent future headaches. Note If you run a small business, take a look at Outright.com, a simple, free bookkeeping site. It’s like Mint or Wesabe (Web-Based Tools) for freelancers and small businesses. Be confident. When you start out, don’t let your customers know you’re nervous. They’re lost, too, and hoping you’ll guide them to the right product or service. So do research and become an expert. And if you make mistakes, learn from them. Charge the going rate — or close to it. If you start a house-cleaning service, don’t go in with low-ball bids. If you’re too cheap, people will think there’s a reason for it. Charge the going rate, and raise your price as demand increases. Have an exit strategy. Know where you’re going and why. Is your goal to sell your business? To have competent employees who can run things, leaving you to pursue other interests? Or is it just a lark, something you’ll do for fun for a few years before dropping it…</p></blockquote><p>Page: 118</p><blockquote><p>As long as you don’t try to do it all at once, it’s not hard to sell your used Stuff.

But if you bump savings to the front of that list, you can set money aside before you come up with reasons to spend it. That way, since the money is no longer in your checking account to tempt you, you end up spending less. It builds a cash buffer you can use later in life.

I could (and should) have walked away, but I’d become emotionally invested: I wanted to drive that car home. In the end, I paid $15,600 — and I traded in my old car for much less than it was worth.

Fortunately, there are smarter ways to buy.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 171</p><blockquote><p>On The Money: Saying Goodbye to Car Payments Despite what you might think, you’re not doomed to have a car payment for the rest of your life. In Chapter 7, you learned the importance of paying yourself first to save for retirement (Get in the game). You can apply the same principle to saving for a car. According to the National Automobile Dealers Association, the average price of a new car is just over $28,000. Let’s say you put $8,000 down to buy a car at that price, and you finance the remaining $20,000 for 4 years at 9% interest, meaning your payments will be just under $500 per month. At the end of those 4 years, you’ll have paid almost $32,000 for a car that’s now worth $14,000. That’s $18,000 vanished into thin air! There is a better way, one recommended by financial gurus like Dave Ramsey and Suze Orman. Instead of financing a new car, take that $8,000 and use it to buy a high-quality used car. Then, instead of paying $500 a month to the finance company, set the money aside in a named bank account specifically for your next car (see Targeted Savings Accounts). That way you’re paying yourself rather than the car company. At the end of a year, your used car will have lost 15% or so of its value, making it worth around $6,800. You can keep driving it and saving for a new car, or take the $6,000 you now have in the bank, combine it with the used car’s value, and trade in for a car worth $12,800. And if you keep saving, the next year you can trade in that second car for one worth $17,000. In theory, after 4 years of this you’ll have paid out $32,000 — just as if you’d bought that new car at 9% interest — but you’ll be driving a car worth $23,000 instead of $14,000. Pretty cool, yeah? Instead of paying interest to a finance company for a vehicle that’s losing value, you’re paying yourself and gradually upgrading your car every year.

Don’t negotiate more than one thing at once.

Time also plays a role — the side with the most time has the advantage. No matter how rushed you are, keep your cool. Don’t ignore deadlines, but don’t follow them blindly either. Information is the final variable: The more you know, the better off you are, so do your research before you start haggling.

Tip For $35, you can get the Carfax (www.carfax.com) vehicle history report, which tells you if the car has been in any accidents, how many owners it’s had, and so on. (Better yet, if you’re buying from a dealer, ask them to pull the report for you — there’s a good chance they already have it on file.) Inspect the car thoroughly. Check the interior, exterior, tires, tailpipe, and engine. When you test drive it, pay attention to the handling and acceleration, and listen for strange noises. Take the vehicle to an independent mechanic. For $100–$150, a mechanic can tell you if the car has any major problems. Make an offer.

Consider having a mechanic check the car and issue a report about its condition. And clean the car (inside and out) until it shines. Research the market. Spend a few weeks reading used-car ads in the newspaper and on Craigslist.org to see what people are asking for similar vehicles. And use the Kelley Blue Book or NADA Guides sites (Selling a Car) to get more info. Set a competitive price. Figure out what you think your car is worth — being honest about its condition and value — then add a little to the price for wiggle room during negotiations. Decide what your rock-bottom price is. Gather your records. Put together a folder with all your car’s maintenance records. If you had a mechanic inspect the car, include his report. Consider getting a vehicle report from Carfax.com to help set the buyer’s mind at ease. And have a bill-of-sale document ready to go. (What you need for a bill of sale depends on where you live, so check your state’s DMV website for details.) Write an ad that sells. Mention features, improvements, and any recent upgrades, like new tires or battery. Have you always parked it in a garage? Say so. Do you have all the maintenance records? Mention that, too. And if you’re posting an ad online, include as many photos as you can. Spread the word. Get as much exposure for your ad as possible. The more demand you can generate, the more money you’ll make. Online, try Craigslist.org, Autotrader.com, and Cars.com. Run your ad in a newspaper over the weekend when it’ll reach the largest audience. Be prepared to answer questions. People will call or email to ask for detailed info. Be ready to provide it by keeping a list of key facts near the phone. Show your car to interested buyers. If you’re nervous about dealing with people, get a friend to help. You’re selling yourself as well as the car, so make a good impression. Let the buyer test-drive it, but be sure to ask for a valid driver’s license first. Go along for the ride, or ask for some sort of collateral (their car keys or wallet, say). If your car has any major defects, be honest about them. Offer to let the buyer take the car to a mechanic of their choice, even if you’ve already taken it to yours. Negotiate a price. A good price is fair to both parties. Having done your research, you know what your car is worth, so be confident and stand strong when somebody tries to lowball you. Remember your rock-bottom price, but if you get an offer that’s only a couple hundred dollars below this figure, consider accepting it. Make the sale. Get cash or a cashier’s check, and then complete the bill of sale to transfer ownership. Be certain that the paperwork includes a statement to this effect: “This vehicle is sold as is. Buyer assumes all liability and guarantees the vehicle will be registered in their name immediately.” Take care of the details. After the sale, cancel your insurance policy for the car and complete any necessary DMV paperwork.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 180</p><blockquote><p>Before you take your car to a shop, check with the Better Business Bureau (www.bbb.org) to see if it has any complaints on file.

If you get a good vibe, use the shop for future service and repairs. If something bugs you about the shop, go elsewhere. Even after you find a good shop, always check your bill and be willing to ask questions. It’s your right to know what you were charged and why.

Pre-approval is more formal than pre-qualifying, and it takes days instead of minutes. The lender will pull your credit report, review your financial info, and check your employment history before giving you a pre-approval letter.

Low fees. Find out what sorts of fees each lender charges. Closing costs (like those listed here: http://tinyurl.com/FR-closing) can have a big impact on the total cost of the mortgage, but many people ignore them, probably because the cost of the mortgage is so huge that these charges seem small by comparison.

Most people opt for a mortgage with a fixed 15- or 30-year term.

(See the table above to compare monthly payments.) If you can keep saving for retirement and other goals despite the higher monthly payments, a 15-year-loan is a great option because it’ll save you a bundle in interest. But if it’s going to crimp your cash flow, go with a 30-year mortgage instead. For most people, a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage is the best choice. The monthly payments are lower than with a 15-year loan, and you have greater flexibility. If you want to pay more than the minimum amount every month, you can (see Should you prepay your mortgage?), but you don’t have to.

Get an independent inspection. A good inspection will cost several hundred dollars, but it’s worth every penny. Ask friends, family, and coworkers to recommend inspectors. Don’t use an inspector recommended by the seller, broker, or real-estate agent; you want somebody who’s thorough and tough, and whose livelihood isn’t tied to others in the process. Tag along during the inspection and ask questions. (You may want to film the house at this time.) Don’t panic if the inspector finds problems; instead, use them to negotiate. Talk to the neighbors.

You won’t find a definitive answer in this book or anywhere else. Ask a dozen different financial experts and you’ll get a dozen different answers — literally: http://tinyurl.com/invest-prepay. Why wouldn’t you pay off your mortgage early? There are actually several sensible reasons you might choose to hang onto that debt: If you prepay in good times, there’s no easy way to get that money back during bad times. The only way to “undo” prepayments is to take out a second mortgage. When you have a mortgage, inflation is your friend: In 30 years, your $2,000 monthly payment will seem like a $500 payment. No matter how much you prepay, the bank doesn’t give you a break — you still have to make payments each month until the mortgage is completely paid off, even if you get sick or lose your job. There’s an opportunity cost to prepaying your mortgage: When you send in an extra payment, you can’t use that money elsewhere — such as investing in the stock market, which might give you a better return. Despite these compelling arguments, millions of Americans prepay their mortgages. Their reasons make sense, too: Prepaying gives you a guaranteed return on your investment equal to whatever your mortgage rate is. That’s because any time you pay down debt, you earn a return equal to the interest rate you’re being charged. So if your home loan has a 6% interest rate, then paying extra on that debt is like earning 6% in a savings account. You’d be hard-pressed to find other places to earn a guaranteed 6% return! Prepaying gives you a safety net. While you’ll still have a mortgage payment until you’ve paid off the loan, when you do pay it off, you’ll have a huge cushion because your monthly expenses will drop by $1,000, $2,000, or even $3,000. Just think of what you could do with that cash flow! People who’ve paid off their homes feel a huge sense of relief (see http://tinyurl.com/GRS-nomortgage). It’s freeing to not have a mortgage holding you down. Few people would argue that prepaying your mortgage is a bad move, but there are some who don’t think it’s the best move. Is prepayment right for you? If you plan to stay in your home for a long time, it may be. The choice depends on your financial goals and what will make you happy. Note When should you refinance your mortgage? When you can recover the costs in a reasonable amount of time, typically just a few years. The standard advice used to be to consider refinancing if interest rates dropped by 2%. But closing costs are lower now, and it often makes sense to refinance sooner. You’ll need to run the numbers based on your own situation using a refinance calculator like the one here: http://tinyurl.com/refi-calc.

Insurance agents are happy to sell you more coverage than your situation calls for. So do some research before you buy. Figure out how much and what kind of insurance you need, and don’t let the agent talk you into more. Raise your deductible. The deductible is the amount you pay on a loss before the insurance company kicks in money. For instance, if your car suffers $400 in damage and you have a $250 deductible, you pay the first $250 and your insurance company pays the rest. It’s up to you where to set the deductible, but the lower your deductible, the higher your monthly premiums. Ask yourself how much you can afford to pay if something goes wrong; more specifically, how much is too much? Set your deductible just below “too much.” Consolidate.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 223</p><blockquote><p>Self-insurance isn’t just a good strategy for appliances.

When you buy and sell securities, you have to pay somebody else to make those trades for you. And every time you pay them, you lose a little piece of your savings. This isn’t a huge deal if you don’t trade often, but if you buy and sell all the time, you’re giving your money away. For example, say it costs 1% each time you sell what you currently own and buy something new. If you do this once a month, you have to earn 12% more every year than the guy who sits there and does nothing. This example is an exaggeration, but studies show that speculators who trade often — usually because they’re chasing the latest hot stock — tend to earn less than investors who take a long-term view.

One of the best ways to do so is with a Roth IRA. An IRA is an individual retirement arrangement, a retirement plan that gives you tax advantages when saving for retirement. There are two types of IRAs: With a traditional IRA (first introduced in 1975), the money you put in is typically tax deductible, but the money you pull out at retirement will be taxed at the then-current rate. With a Roth IRA (first introduced in 1997), you contribute after-tax dollars, but when you retire, you don’t have to pay taxes on the returns the money earned. (These IRAs get their name from Delaware senator William Roth, who helped pass the law that created them.) In other words, money in a traditional IRA is taxed when you withdraw it, but the money in a Roth IRA is taxed before you contribute it. (For more on the difference between Roth IRAs and traditional IRAs, see the box on Extreme Retirement Saving.) You make investments in an IRA through an individual retirement account. Many folks use the term “IRA” interchangeably to refer to both individual retirement arrangements and individual retirement accounts, but there are some important differences. You have just one Roth IRA, for example, but you can have many Roth IRA accounts. That is, you can have a Roth IRA account at your credit union and one with your mutual fund company, but they’re both part of the same IRA. (It’s kind of like how this page and the last one are both part of the same book.) One important thing to realize is that an IRA isn’t itself an investment — it’s a place to put investments. When you open an IRA account, it’s like an empty bucket just waiting to be filled. The things you put into your IRA bucket are investments. You might, for example, buy stocks to put into your bucket, or maybe bonds. Some people use their IRA accounts to buy investment real estate, and some simply let their cash sit there, earning interest in CDs, just as it would if it were deposited in the bank down the street (which may actually be where they keep their IRA account!). As you might expect after reading the last chapter, smart people mix up the contents of their IRA accounts over time. Their buckets might contain a combination of stocks, mutual funds, bonds, and real estate. (When you start out, your bucket will probably hold just a single investment, and that’s fine.)</p></blockquote><p>Page: 293</p><blockquote><p>Explain your goals.

Then, do nothing: Don’t touch the money. Take time to let your emotions pass so you can get over the initial urge to spend it all on a big house or a fancy car. Live your life just as you did before.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 305</p><blockquote><p>In It’s Not About the Money (HarperOne, 2009), Brent Kessel writes that the act of giving is “the yoga of money”: “The yoga of money is the act of using money to affirm and enhance our sense of unity, with money itself, and ultimately with something greater than all physical forms.”</p></blockquote><p>Page: 306</p><blockquote><p>Social Capital You create social capital — mutual goodwill — when you volunteer at a soup kitchen, help your neighbor move a piano, have your Sunday School class over for a barbeque, or join a softball league.
