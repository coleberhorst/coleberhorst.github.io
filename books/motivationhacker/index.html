Motivation hacking is the process of figuring out what you want to be more excited about, then coming up with strategies for manipulating the terms in this equation. Motivation is what you always want more of: fire, energy, excitement! It’s that which drives you to act, to achieve your goals. Expectancy is your confidence of success. When you’re sure you can win (high Expectancy), motivation is high. When you think you’ll probably fail even if you try, you won’t try—motivation is low. Value is both how rewarding a task will be when you finish it and how fun it is while you’re doing it. Working on goals that are important to you brings high motivation. Doing boring, pointless things causes low motivation.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 11</p><blockquote><p>Impulsiveness can be thought of as distractibility: how likely you are to put a task off and do something more pressing. When you have other things you’d much rather be doing, your Impulsiveness is high, and your motivation low. If there’s nothing else you could be doing right now, then Impulsiveness is low and motivation high. Delay is how far off the reward seems to be. This is often hard to manipulate directly: rewards are often delayed so far that we hyperbolically discount[14] them into worthlessness. But sometimes you can set yourself up to perceive Delay</p></blockquote><p>Page: 12</p><blockquote><p>differently, thus scoring a big motivation win. By increasing Expectancy or Value, or decreasing Impulsiveness or Delay, you hack motivation.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 13</p><blockquote><p>Motivation hackers are in danger of achieving the wrong goals.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 14</p><blockquote><p>The biggest hack a motivation hacker can perform is to build her confidence to the size of a volcano. An oversized eruption of Expectancy can incinerate all obstacles in the path to any goal when you combine it with good planning.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 17</p><blockquote><p>when you’re surrounded by distractions. But when you remove distractions in advance, no such effort is required: concentration flows. The motivation hacker learns to anticipate and eliminate distractions and temptations, making it trivial to follow through with her plans.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 18</p><blockquote><p>We humans are built to hyperbolically discount rewards based on how far in the future they are. We all do it slightly differently as measured by experimental psychologists and economists—a dollar today might seem worth sixty cents to me if I must wait until tomorrow, whereas to you it might seem worth eighty cents—but it’s a huge bias for all of</p></blockquote><p>Page: 18</p><blockquote><p>The motivation hacker learns to structure goals so that the perceived Delay is not so great. Intermediate milestones, process-based goals, and willfully optimistic planning are his tools here. With the right mindset, success is ever right around the corner.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 20</p><blockquote><p>A third model of willpower is that willpower works like a muscle only if you believe it does[21]. If you think that resisting a cookie will make you slack off later, then you’re more likely to eat the cookie in hopes of saving willpower for working later, or to slack off if you’ve already done well by resisting the cookie. If you don’t believe in willpower as an exhaustible resource, then the cookie has no effect on slacking off. In this case, you don’t generate the excuses which sap willpower. Some thinkers have suggested that willpower</p></blockquote><p>Page: 20</p><blockquote><p>cognitive intervention to override our natural interests. Psychologist George Ainslie’s response to this is my favorite concept of will[22]: “the will is a recursive process that bets the expected value of your future self-control against each of your successive temptations.” That is, will is simply the process of making personal rules for ourselves that will help us reach our goals, and how much willpower we can muster is precisely how good we are at setting up these personal rules so that the we always prefer to keep our rules than to break them. This is a learnable skill.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 23</p><blockquote><p>You can always re-up your success spiral on that goal if you’re still interested, or make it harder or easier. Often, though, your interests will move on, and you don’t want to be stuck doing something of low Value just to strengthen your Expectancy. The important part is to never weasel out of doing what you said you’d do.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 26</p><blockquote><p>No To-Dos older than 3 days - make sure no miscellaneous tasks have remained undone longer than three days</p></blockquote><p>Page: 26</p><blockquote><p>•  Feedback limit - check email and Skritter forum no more than every 90 minutes •  Surfing limit - spend no more than 30 minutes per day on misc internet</p></blockquote><p>Page: 26</p><blockquote><p>Social - go out and be social at least 5 days a week</p></blockquote><p>Page: 26</p><blockquote><p>•  Mentally contrast[30] goals - for each goal, spend a little time thinking about where I am vs. where I’d like to be</p></blockquote><p>Page: 27</p><blockquote><p>before!

The harder you try, the more likely you are to succeed, but the more Expectancy you will lose if you fail. If you are facing a goal difficult enough to require all your effort, then you stand to risk all future possibility of success if you try hard but not hard enough. If you fail, those rationalizations will not work. Your bone will be broken, your success spiral shattered, and your remaining Expectancy gone, and you will know it. You won’t be able to tell yourself that it was just because you didn’t try or because you didn’t have the right technique, and that you’ll try harder with a better method next time. So you’d better succeed this time.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 36</p><blockquote><p>situation.

You might flinch away from the problem, saying to yourself, “I need to finish <Transparent Excuse=""> before I can focus on reducing my drinking,” or “I could probably start dating any time, but I can wait until after this work project is done.” I find that journaling helps with this. It’s much easier for me to tell when I’m lying to myself when I write things down, or especially when I hesitate to write about something. If it’s not a problem, then why am I so reluctant to engage it and prove that?</Transparent></p></blockquote><p>Page: 52</p><blockquote><p>Why should we fear rejection? We can guess at an evolutionary psychological explanation that when you lived in a tribe of 50 people, being rejected by one of the four eligible mates would mean losing a quarter of your dating pool, so it would make sense to be cautious and avoid possible rejection. But today’s dating pool is much larger, and most of the strangers you could make a fool of yourself in front of will never see you again. There is no longer much need to fear rejection from strangers. Rejection Therapy is an exercise designed to get you over this useless fear. It uses the psychological tactic of “flooding”: you expose yourself to the terrifying stimulus over and over until you get over it and instinctively realize there’s nothing to be afraid of. There are a few different flavors, like the thirty-day challenge where you must be rejected at least once per day, but the one that I did only took an hour. Some friends</p></blockquote><p>Page: 54</p><blockquote><p>When you make yourself the rule, I’m going to ask the next person I see if I can have a hug, and then you see someone who looks particularly terrifying to approach, your brain will try to help you out with some rationalizations: … except for her, since she’s too pretty / too old / too young / walking with someone / going somewhere / too tall / too looking-like-she-doesn’t-want-to-be-bothered. This feeling, of wanting or not wanting to do something for a basic reason (fear, laziness, hunger, etc.) and then giving yourself a higher-level excuse for why that’s okay, should trigger alarms whenever you notice it. Note that this rationalization is also how most goals die—you convince yourself that it’s okay to not do what you told yourself you would do—and if you can develop the habit of noticing it and defeating it, then you’ll be more effective in achieving your goals. I fixed twenty unpleasant bugs that I’d been avoiding for months in the first three days after I started practicing the noticing of rationalization. (I later lost the habit, which is a tough one. Later I’ll try another exercise to get myself to hold onto the skill of avoiding rationalization.)</p></blockquote><p>Page: 55</p><blockquote><p>away.

If you don’t know how to do something, then motivate yourself to spend the time figuring it out.

Before I knew it, I graduated with 142 out of 112 credits, highest honors, a triple major in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, and East Asian Studies, and only two close friends (my startup cofounders). My college adventure count was low, and I never used my high GPA[65], my degree, or anything I learned in those extra classes I slept through.[66] That was dumb.

In other words, the well-being described by the remembering self is an illusion.[68] You could call the well-being given by the experiencing self “happiness” and that given by the remembering self “life satisfaction”. Unfortunately for us, the remembering self makes all the planning decisions, charting all of our goals across its bizarre cognitive geography. We ignore process and focus on conclusion; we overestimate both negative and positive impacts of possible events; we hyperbolically discount like a fishmonger going out of business; and we make disconnected events fit into consistent life stories. We end up with bad goals that don’t make us happy while we’re achieving them and which give only fleeting satisfaction when we’re done.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 64</p><blockquote><p>My solution to calibrating my remembering self’s planning to my experiencing self’s well-being is to randomly ping myself to record my happiness right now, along with what I’m doing.

Sometimes people are afraid to be specific about a goal because they’re not sure what they want or what they’ll be able to accomplish—what if they commit to the wrong goal? But without a plan, they’re not likely to succeed; they should plan as well as they can and then set a time limit on the goal so that if it turns out to not be worthwhile, at least they can stop afterward. Stopping after you reach a goal is better than stopping before you start, during your pursuit, or never.</p></blockquote><p>Page: 104</p><blockquote><p>The major motivation hacking techniques I use—success spirals, precommitment, burnt ships, and being a task samurai—are</p></blockquote><p>Page: 105</p><blockquote><p>Guarding Against Excessive Optimism.

Set up extra reminders of these connections where you’ll see them. •  Set CSI Approach Goals. SMART goals are out, and Challenging, Specific, Immediate, and Approach (not avoidance) goals are in. These goals should excite you (the Challenging and Approach bits). The Specific and Immediate bits help with Impulsiveness, making sure you know what you need to do at any time. I find that input goals (study ten minutes daily) tend to work better than output goals (learn ten words daily). •  Optimize Energy. Everything is more fun if you’re alert, not tired. Sleep well, eat well, get fit, guard your circadian rhythms, and avoid burnout. Cure energy lows with quality breaks, movement, sunshine, and good music. Match intensive tasks with periods of high energy. •  Productive Procrastination. If you can’t bring yourself to do your main task, at least get some other things out of the way. It’s not perfect, but perfect is the enemy of good. •  Create Rewards. When you succeed, celebrate it, either by congratulating yourself or giving yourself a treat.
